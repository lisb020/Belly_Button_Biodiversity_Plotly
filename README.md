# Belly_Button_Biodiversity_Plotly

## Project Description

This project builds an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. It uses `Javascript`, `html`, `D3` library, `plotly` library, and `Bootstrap`.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Project Details

1. Uses the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

2. Creates a horizontal bar chart and gauge chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. Creates a bubble chart that displays each sample where the marker colors change with OTU IDs and the marker size changes by the sample value.

4. Displays the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. The webpage is interactive and updates all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected from the dropdown menu.

note: html was already provided
